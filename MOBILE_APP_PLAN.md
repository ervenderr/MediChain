# üì± MediChain Mobile App Development Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the development of a native mobile application for MediChain, complementing the existing web PWA. The mobile app will provide the same core functionality as the web version while leveraging native mobile capabilities like camera access, biometric authentication, push notifications, and offline data caching.

**Target Platforms:** iOS and Android  
**Technology Stack:** React Native with Expo  
**Design Approach:** Follow existing web UI/UX design system with mobile optimizations

## üéØ Project Goals

- **Native Performance:** Leverage device capabilities (camera, biometrics, notifications)
- **Offline Capability:** Full functionality without internet connection
- **Seamless UX:** Consistent with web app design and user experience
- **Security First:** Maintain enterprise-grade security standards
- **Cross-Platform:** Single codebase for iOS and Android
